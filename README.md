# Jumia Laptop Dataset Cleaning Project

This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a dataset obtained from Jumia, an e-commerce platform, containing information about laptop listings.

## Overview

The dataset was collected from Jumia's website and includes various attributes such as laptop brand, specifications, prices, ratings, and customer reviews. The goal of this project is to clean the dataset, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and prepare it for further analysis.

## Files

- `jumia_laptop_dataset.csv`: The raw dataset obtained from Jumia.
- `data_cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Data Cleaning Process

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Read the raw dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **Handling Missing Values**: Use techniques such as imputation or removal to address missing values.
4. **Removing Duplicates**: Remove duplicate entries from the dataset.
5. **Data Transformation**: Convert data types, standardize formats, and perform any necessary transformations.
6. **Saving the Cleaned Dataset**: Save the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file for further analysis.
